# ESS 590D OPTICAL FIBER GEOPHYSICS
## PROBLEM SET 1

Our goal is to spend 4 hours per week on outside-of-class activities.  Therefore, please spend no more than this amount of time on the following two exercises.  We will check in next week to see how far you've gotten.  Although the assignments are strictly graded for correctness, you are able to revise your assignment as many times as you'd like before the end of the term.

### Exercise 1
The electric boundary condition along the interface between two dielectric materials is,

$\mathbf{E_1}^{||} = \mathbf{E_2}^{||}$

where $\circ^{||}$ denotes the component of a vector field that is parallel to the interface.  The result of this exercise will be a proof of this boundary condition.  To carry out this proof, begin with Ampere's law in integral form.  (The integral form can easily be obtained from the derivative form by applying vector calculus identities.). 

Next, consider a thin rectangular loop straddling the interface. The loop consists of four connected segments: two strands that are parallel to the interface (one on the "top" side and one on the "bottom" side) and two strands that are pierce through the interface at normal incidence.  What happens to the terms in the Amperian path integral in the limit where the loop becomes very close to the surface (i.e., the two segments that are normal to the interface become very short)?

### Exercise 2
Carry out the reflection-transmission analysis that we did in class for electromagnetic waves with transverse magnetic (TM) polarization. Recall that in class, our derivation assumed transverse electric (TE) polarization.
