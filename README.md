# Optical Fiber Geophysics (ESS 490d/590d)
> Just as the 20th century was the century of the electron, the 21st century will be the century of the photon.

## Motivation
- Distributed optical fiber sensors are the biggest revolution in geophysical instrumentation since digitization.
- We will learn about how these systems work. We will focus on the general physical principles that explain how present-day technologies work while keeping an open mind about future sensing tech that we haven’t even dreamed of yet.
- A significant new Distributed Acoustic Sensing dataset from the Cook Inlet, Alaska, will come online mid-way through the course.
- We will have the ambitious goal of submitting a peer-reviewed journal article concerning the Cook Inlet Dataset.  We would target a publication in the new Diamond Open Access journal, Seismica.  Seismica mirrors the “DataVerse” format of SRL: https://www.seismosoc.org/publications/srl/srl-data-mine-author-information/

## Workload
- This is an 2-credit course
- The expected workload for a 2-credit course at UW consists of 4 hours of work outside of class time per week.

## Grading (25% each for 590 students // 33% each for 490 students)
- Two homework assignments
- Field experience participation
- In-class project presentation
- Delivery of project code, text, and figures — Only required for 590 students
